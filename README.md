🌀 FLUID-SIM

FLUID-SIM is an interactive fluid simulation written in C++ using OpenGL, designed to experiment with the principles of fluid mechanics and particle-based systems in real time.

🎯 Project Objective

This project was primarily developed as a way for me to learn and experiment with OpenGL in C++, exploring its modern structure — including shader programming, buffer management, and the graphics pipeline.
The idea was to combine this learning process with a topic I’m passionate about — fluid physics simulation — in order to create an interactive and realistic visualization while strengthening my skills in low-level programming, scientific computing, and 3D rendering.
